# Variational-autoencoder-VAE
Deep learning techniques such as variational autoencoder (VAE) have shown promise in clustering survey responses. 
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a deep learning generative model that encodes input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decodes it back to the original high-dimensional space in order to learn a compact representation of the data. 
Currently, VAE-based data analysis methods are being successfully applied in various fields of science and technology, such as image and video analysis, natural language processing, anomaly detection, drug discovery and recommendation systems.
The purpose of this study is to present and evaluate the effectiveness of a new method for grouping survey responses using Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
